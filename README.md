# Simple Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a simple game for users to play 5 rounds of rock, paper, scissors against the computer, using the console. The computer uses the math.random() method to "pick" rock, paper or scissors, while users are prompted for their input upon loading the page. The goal of this project was to use some simple functions and programming basics to create a simple, working program.
